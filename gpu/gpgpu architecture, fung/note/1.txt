gpu real-time rendering 实时渲染 (real time = response within specified time constraints in milliseconds or microseconds)
apple a8 processor: more die 裸芯 area to gpu than to cpu
die = small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated
for many decades, increasing performance due to reduced transistor sizes

22
gpu is unlikely replace cpu entirely
in present systems gpu are not stand-alone computing devices
cpu initiate computation on gpu and transfer data to and from gpu

23
discrete gpu: a bus connecting cpu and gpu
separate dram memory spaces for cpu (system memory) and gpu (device memory)
cpu dram: optimized for low latency access (memory latency 延迟 = time delay between initiating a request for a byte or word in memory until it is retrieved by a processor)
gpu dram: optimized for high throughput 吞吐量 (bits / second, packets / second, amount of data transfered from src to dest over time period) /* bandwidth 带宽 measures maximum capacity of data transfered over time, in bits / second */

integrated cpu and gpu: share single cache and dram memory space
low-power mobile devices

older discrete gpu:
cpu portion of program orchestrate movement of data from cpu memory to gpu memory
nvidia pascal architecture: 
auto transfer data from cpu memory to gpu memory, nvidia unified memory

24
gpu composed of many cores
nvidia call them streaming multiprocessors 流式多处理器, advanced micro devices 超微半导体 call them compute units
each gpu executes a single instruction multiple thread program
each core on a gpu execute order of thousand threads

threads executing on a single core can communicate through a scratchpad 便签存储器 memory
large number threads running on a core to hide memory access latency when data is not found in first-level caches
gddr: graphics double data rate 图像双倍数据传输率存储器

25
when large cache shared among small #threads, performance increases with #threads
if #threads increases to the point that cache cannot hold entire working set, performance decreases
performance valley may occur if #threads is insufficient to cover off-chip memory access latency

32 bit int add        0.1
32 bit float add      0.9
32 bit int mult       3.1

nvidia introduced programmability to gpu in form of vertex shaders 
and pixel shaders in geforce 3
