while amount of on-chip mem storage per thread is small, caches can reduce a sizable number of off-chip mem accesses
spatial locality between adjacent pixel operations that can be captured by on-chip caches
pipeline: simt front-end, simd back-end
3 scheduling loops in a pipeline: instruction fetch, instruction issue, register access scheduling

one-loop approx:
unit of scheduling is a warp 弯曲
in each cycle, hardware selects a warp for scheduling 
in time.h, CLOCKS_PER_SEC = 10^6
10^6 clocks in 1 second
warp's %rip is used to access an instruction mem to find next instruction to execute for warp
a given function unit supports only a subset of instructions
