transactional memory 事务存储 attempts to simplify concurrent programming by allowing a group of load and store instructions to execute in an atomic way
at runtime, gpu hardware executes groups of scalar threads, called warps 调度器或调度单元 (or wavefronts 波阵面 in amd (advanced micro devices 超微半导体) terminology)
in lockstep 齐步 on simd hardware
discrete gpu: cpu portion of program allocate memory on gpu and initiate transfer of input data into gpu memory, launch a kernel on gpu

30
code carefully optimized for one architecure (gpu) may perform poorly on another (cpu)
single precision scalar value a times vector value x plus vector value y, a * x + y, known as saxpy

32
threads of a compute kernel organized into a grid of thread blocks consisting of warps
