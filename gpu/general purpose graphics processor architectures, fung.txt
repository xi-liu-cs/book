gpu real time rendering 实时渲染 (real time = response within specified time constraints in milliseconds or microseconds)
apple a8 processor: more die 裸芯 area to gpu than to cpu
die = small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated

for many decades, increasing performance due to reduced transistor sizes
