gpu real-time rendering 实时渲染 (real time = response within specified time constraints in milliseconds or microseconds)
apple a8 processor: more die 裸芯 area to gpu than to cpu
die = small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated
for many decades, increasing performance due to reduced transistor sizes

22
gpu is unlikely replace cpu entirely
in present systems gpu are not stand-alone computing devices
cpu initiate computation on gpu and transfer data to and from gpu

23
discrete gpu: a bus connecting cpu and gpu
separate dram memory spaces for cpu (system memory) and gpu (device memory)
cpu dram: optimized for low latency access (memory latency 延迟 = time delay between initiating a request for a byte or word in memory until it is retrieved by a processor)
gpu dram: optimized for high throughput 吞吐量 (bits / second, packets / second, amount of data transfered from src to dest over time period) /* bandwidth 带宽 measures maximum capacity of data transfered over time, in bits / second */

integrated cpu and gpu: share single cache and dram memory space
low-power mobile devices

older discrete gpu:
cpu portion of program orchestrate movement of data from cpu memory to gpu memory
nvidia pascal architecture: 
auto transfer data from cpu memory to gpu memory, nvidia unified memory
